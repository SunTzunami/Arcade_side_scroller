# Transience Animation

## Preview

![Preview](Demo/preview.gif)

An attempt at making an animation of one of my favourite anime characters- Uchiha Itachi.
I made this by using the Python Arcade framework.
I've used a track called Feather by Nujabes as the background music. I designed all the sprites and the backgrounds from scratch.
This repo stores all the necessary files required to view the animation.
Duration of the animation - 1 minute 3 seconds (approximately). You can see Itachi grow with time (Kid -> Clan killer -> Akatsuki -> Edo Tensei)
# To view the animation
Clone the repo and run Main_long_version.py. It'll run flawlessly provided you have Arcade module installed (No other modules are necessary).
